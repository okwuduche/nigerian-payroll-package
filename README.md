# Nigerian Payroll Package

## Helping Human Resource Department of SMEs solve Payroll related problems for free

In this repo, I will be sharing components of payroll application as I build them. This is free for anyone who cares to use them. It is my way of giving back to the society. Haven worked as an Internal Auditor and as an Accountant for over 6 years, I found out that many HR staff detest computing any statutory deductions like PAYE, etc.

I have in the past built a PAYE excel template that anyone can use to easily compute PAYE [PAYE excel template with formula](https://accountantnextdoor.com/payroll-fundamentals-in-nigeria-how-to-compute-paye-in-microsoft-excel/). However, a lot of people still contact me for further assistance. In a bid to help more people at the same time, I ventured into the world of programming.

Hence, the main motivation for embarking on this journey of becoming a full fledge Software Engineer is to help organizations in Nigeria (and other countries on Prohressive tax system) escape the nightmare of dealing with computing the correct PAYE and other components of payroll especially SMEs on budget.
